# KAG Sequel Discussion

Repo for discussing what we think a sequel to KAG could look like, with the ultimate goal of providing a foundation of player opinions and thoughts to whoever ends up building the game.

### I have an idea! Where can I write it?
Great! Create a new issue and write out thoughfully and clearly on what you think should be changed. Screenshots of other games/mockups are beneficial.

### I don't like someone's ideas...
Feel free to reply to any issues and give feedback on why you think something should/shouldn't be added.
